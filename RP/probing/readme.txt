%%%%%%%%%    Probing data with freq=0.318 and %damp=8.3%     %%%%%%%%%%

1) prob_data.m       -    creating three windows from the probing signal


2) ran_decre_1.m     -    random decrement of the non linear filtered signal for the first window

6) ran_decre_2.m     -    random decrement of the non linear filtered signal for the second window
 
7) ran_decre_3.m     -    random decrement of the non linear filtered signal for the third window

8) Solu_prob.m       -    TLS-ESPRIT to find the modes

9) x_mal1.mat        -    signal for window 1

10) x_mal2.mat       -    signal for window 2

11) x_mal8.mat       -    signal for window 3

12) mal1.mat         -    signal with white noise for window 1

13) mal2.mat         -    signal with white noise for window 2

14) mal8.mat         -    signal with white noise for window 3
 
15) mal1_94          -    impulse response with peak=9.4 for window 1 

16) mal2_14          -    impulse response with peak=14 for window 2 

17) mal8_78          -    impulse response with peak=7.8 for window 3
